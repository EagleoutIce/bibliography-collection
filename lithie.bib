  abstract   = {As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

These package managers use different security mechanisms that provide varying levels of usability and resilience to attack. We find that, despite their existing security mechanisms, all of these package managers have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle or a malicious mirror. While all current package managers suffer from vulnerabilities, their security is also positively or negatively impacted by the distribution's security practices. Weaknesses in package managers are more easily exploited when distributions use third-party mirrors as official mirrors. We were successful in using false credentials to obtain an official mirror on all five of the distributions we attempted. We also found that some security mechanisms that control where a client obtains metadata and packages from may actually decrease security. We analyze current package managers to show that by exploiting vulnerabilities, an attacker with a mirror can compromise or crash hundreds to thousands of clients weekly. The problems we disclose are now being corrected by many different package manager maintainers.},

Any scientific process, including software simulations, must be able to be replicated in order to prove the robustness of its process and the validity of its results. If an approach based on the extensive documentation of the process itself maybe considered as sufficient to guarantee reproducibility of results in domains like Physics or Biology, such a requirement proves to be incomplete for software being executed on high performance computing platforms. The specifics of the customized and exotic HPC architectures, the fast evolution of the software development environment as well as the various variables that can pollute the software development and building process are just few of the many possible sources of scientific result corruption. We describe in this paper how the developers of the Blue Brain Project built a software development ecosystem based on the Nix packaging and build system in order to guarantee the full portability, traceability and reproducibility of scientific results.},

  abstract   = {Software-update mechanisms are critical to the security of modern systems, but their typically centralized design presents a lucrative and frequently attacked target. In this work, we propose CHAINIAC, a decentralized software-update framework that eliminates single points of failure, enforces transparency, and provides efficient verifiability of integrity and authenticity for software-release processes. Independent witness servers collectively verify conformance of software updates to release policies, build verifiers validate the source-to-binary correspondence, and a tamper-proof release log stores collectively signed updates, thus ensuring that no release is accepted by clients before being widely disclosed and validated. The release log embodies a skipchain, a novel data structure, enabling arbitrarily out-of-date clients to efficiently validate updates and signing keys. Evaluation of our CHAINIAC prototype on reproducible Debian packages shows that the automated update process takes the average of 5 minutes per release for individual packages, and only 20 seconds for the aggregate timeline. We further evaluate the framework using real-world data from the PyPI package repository and show that it offers clients security comparable to verifying every single update themselves while consuming only one-fifth of the bandwidth and having a minimal computational overhead.},

The course devotes very little time, if any, to actual compiler construction, a topic better suited for a course in compiler writing. However, one could discuss how an existing compiler could propagate an image of itself to another machine. This technique, popularly referred to as bootstrapping or cross-compiling, has been around for years. The literature frequently limits details and thus may incorrectly convey that cross-compiling is quick and easy to do. This paper discusses the author's experience with moving a compiler, written in the language it compiles, from an IBM machine to a Control Data machine.},

  abstract   = {An air force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson's famous Turing award lecture "reflections on trusting trust, " showed that compilers can be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical software, including themselves. If this attack goes undetected, even complete analysis of a system's source code can not find the malicious code that is running, and methods for detecting this particular attack are not widely known. This paper describes a practical technique, termed diverse double-compiling (DDC), that detects this attack and some compiler defects as well. Simply recompile the source code twice: once with a second (trusted) compiler, and again using the result of the first compilation. If the result is bit-for-bit identical with the untrusted binary, then the source code accurately represents the binary. This technique has been mentioned informally, but its issues and ramifications have not been identified or discussed in a peer-reviewed work, nor has a public demonstration been made. This paper describes the technique, justifies it, describes how to overcome practical challenges, and demonstrates it},

  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {There is implicit trust involved when using computer software. Open-source software attempts to inspire more trust, by giving access to the source code. Nevertheless, malicious compilers or someone with malicious intent can create malicious compiled code, even from non-malicious source code. Further, comparing source code and compiled code for equivalence is an undecidable problem. This thesis explores how software can be manipulated so that source code and compiled code are no longer equivalent and what can be done to increase the trust that they are equivalent. One such way of manipulating the compiled code is through a malicious compiler. I demonstrate this by implementing a self-replicating compiler attack against the Go language compiler, a modern industrial-strength compiler. The attack is similar to the well-known trusting trust attack and can infect a new compiler when it is being compiled, even when the compiler is compiled from non-malicious source code. In the thesis, I also discuss other, real-world, compiler attacks such as XcodeGhost and W32/Induc. The attacks show that compiler attacks are viable and a real threat. I discuss how reproducible builds can be used to increase the trust in compiled code, when the source code is available. Also discussed, is how Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC) can be used to detect self-replicating compiler attacks. I introduce a variant of DDC using more than two compilers for bootstrapping, this variant has not previously been described. This new variant can, by utilising parallel trust combinations, increase the trust in the verified compiler beyond regular DDC and identify which compiler has inserted a self-replicating attack. The new variant is implemented, and used to detect the previously implemented self-replicating attack.},
