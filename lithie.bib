  abstract   = {Software-update mechanisms are critical to the security of modern systems, but their typically centralized design presents a lucrative and frequently attacked target. In this work, we propose CHAINIAC, a decentralized software-update framework that eliminates single points of failure, enforces transparency, and provides efficient verifiability of integrity and authenticity for software-release processes. Independent witness servers collectively verify conformance of software updates to release policies, build verifiers validate the source-to-binary correspondence, and a tamper-proof release log stores collectively signed updates, thus ensuring that no release is accepted by clients before being widely disclosed and validated. The release log embodies a skipchain, a novel data structure, enabling arbitrarily out-of-date clients to efficiently validate updates and signing keys. Evaluation of our CHAINIAC prototype on reproducible Debian packages shows that the automated update process takes the average of 5 minutes per release for individual packages, and only 20 seconds for the aggregate timeline. We further evaluate the framework using real-world data from the PyPI package repository and show that it offers clients security comparable to verifying every single update themselves while consuming only one-fifth of the bandwidth and having a minimal computational overhead.},

  abstract   = {An air force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson's famous Turing award lecture "reflections on trusting trust, " showed that compilers can be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical software, including themselves. If this attack goes undetected, even complete analysis of a system's source code can not find the malicious code that is running, and methods for detecting this particular attack are not widely known. This paper describes a practical technique, termed diverse double-compiling (DDC), that detects this attack and some compiler defects as well. Simply recompile the source code twice: once with a second (trusted) compiler, and again using the result of the first compilation. If the result is bit-for-bit identical with the untrusted binary, then the source code accurately represents the binary. This technique has been mentioned informally, but its issues and ramifications have not been identified or discussed in a peer-reviewed work, nor has a public demonstration been made. This paper describes the technique, justifies it, describes how to overcome practical challenges, and demonstrates it},

However, one could discuss how an existing compiler could propagate an image of itself to another machine. This technique, popularly referred to as bootstrapping or cross-compiling, has been around for years. The literature frequently limits details and thus may incorrectly convey that cross-compiling is quick and easy to do.

  title    = {Improving Trust in Software through Diverse Double-Compiling and Reproducible Builds},
  year     = {2018},
  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {There is implicit trust involved when using computer software. Open-source software attempts to inspire more trust, by giving access to the source code. Nevertheless, malicious compilers or someone with malicious intent can create malicious compiled code, even from non-malicious source code. Further, comparing source code and compiled code for equivalence is an undecidable problem. This thesis explores how software can be manipulated so that source code and compiled code are no longer equivalent and what can be done to increase the trust that they are equivalent. One such way of manipulating the compiled code is through a malicious compiler. I demonstrate this by implementing a self-replicating compiler attack against the Go language compiler, a modern industrial-strength compiler. The attack is similar to the well-known trusting trust attack and can infect a new compiler when it is being compiled, even when the compiler is compiled from non-malicious source code. In the thesis, I also discuss other, real-world, compiler attacks such as XcodeGhost and W32/Induc. The attacks show that compiler attacks are viable and a real threat. I discuss how reproducible builds can be used to increase the trust in compiled code, when the source code is available. Also discussed, is how Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC) can be used to detect self-replicating compiler attacks. I introduce a variant of DDC using more than two compilers for bootstrapping, this variant has not previously been described. This new variant can, by utilising parallel trust combinations, increase the trust in the verified compiler beyond regular DDC and identify which compiler has inserted a self-replicating attack. The new variant is implemented, and used to detect the previously implemented self-replicating attack.},

Individuals come to “know” their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/ or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states. This chapter traces the conceptual antecedents and empirical consequences of these propositions, attempts to place the theory in a slightly enlarged frame of reference, and clarifies just what phenomena the theory can and cannot account for in the rapidly growing experimental literature of self-attribution phenomena. Several experiments and paradigms from the cognitive dissonance literature are amenable to self-perception interpretations. But precisely because such experiments are subject to alternative interpretations, they cannot be used as unequivocal evidence for self-perception theory. The reinterpretation of cognitive dissonance phenomena and other self-perception phenomena have been discussed. The chapter highlights some differences between self-perception and interpersonal perception and shift of paradigm in social psychology. It discusses some unsolved problems, such as the conceptual status of noncognitive response classes and the strategy of functional analysis.}
